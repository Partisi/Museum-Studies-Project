# Museum Studies Project - Merchant House

## Purpose
This project is a small AR/VR experience that celebrates museums and historical sites by providing a new way to learn about its history. Our mission was to focus on accessibility through technology. In this Web App, we set the user in the world of the [Merchant House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant's_House_Museum), a small historical house in New York City's East Village with rich history and an abundance of stories.

You can access the game here https://partisi.github.io/Museum-Studies-Project/. 

Enjoy!

*Note, you must enable your camera to go through the AR portion.*
